	  <h1>This game is called 7 minutes, created by Kyle Lane</h1>
	<p>The game plays like a choose your own adventure story with a different story each time.<br>
    	Content can be missed so for the full experience you may play multiple times.<br>
    	For the best experience, refrain from using the built in back button. The game officially ends when there are no more on screen links.<br>
    	<br>
    	Be weary, this game touches on somber topics such as death.<br>
    	Enjoy!</p>
