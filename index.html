    This game is called 7 minutes, created by Kyle Lane <br />
    The game plays like a choose your own adventure story with a different story each time.<br />
    Content can be missed so for the full experience you may play multiple times.<br />
    For the best experience, refrain from using the built in back button. The game officially ends when there are no more on screen links.<br />
    <br />
    Be weary, this game touches on somber topics such as death.<br />
    Enjoy!<br />
